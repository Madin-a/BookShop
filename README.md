## I love books. I love this moment when you open it and plunge into another reality. You seem to be escaping from the whole world into a story much more interesting than your own will ever be ...
Books don't really teach you anything new. Books just help you see what is already inside you. This is enlightenment.

You need to meet for love, for the rest there are books.

We are all sick and can read only those books that tell us about our diseases.

##### Good friends, good books, and a sleeping conscience are the perfect life.
